WP-Trip-Summary
===============
A WordPress trip summary plugin. I initially wrote this for my own personal use, as I needed something to help me keep structured information about my trips.
However, as I was getting ready to push this to production I realised it would be a good idea to go public and publish the source code.

There are, of course, some things to be done before this would be of any real use to anyone but me and in the process some breaking changes may occur.
Please see the [issues](https://github.com/alexboia/WP-Trip-Summary/issues) area for the progress on those things.

## What it does
This plug-in provides two basic features:
- allow some structured information to be filled in, according to a selected trip type;
- allow some GPX track to be uploaded and then rendered on a map.

### Structured information
Structured information is supported for the following types of trips:
- Bike trips;
- Hiking trips;
- Train rides.

#### For bike trips

#### For hiking trips

#### For train rides

### The track
