## Report a bug

[You can use New issue -> Bug report](https://github.com/alexboia/WP-Trip-Summary/issues/new/choose) to file a new bug report. 
Please do so even if you are not sure whether or not the product should behave the way you expect it to, as this may hide, at the very least, some shortages in the way the plug-in communicates what it does.

## Request a feature you would like implemented

[You can use New Issue -> Feature request](https://github.com/alexboia/WP-Trip-Summary/issues/new/choose) to propose a new feature for this plug-in.
If it is an already existing feature, go ahead anyway and propose a way to enhance it.

## Help with translating the plug-in

## Actively contribute to the code base

You can contribute to the code base itself either by:
   - writing code to fix a specific bug or implement a feature; 
   - or by proposing refactoring of existing code ([New issue -> Propose refactoring](https://github.com/alexboia/WP-Trip-Summary/issues/new/choose)).
