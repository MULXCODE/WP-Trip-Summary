WP-Trip-Summary
===============
A WordPress trip summary plugin. I initially wrote this for my own personal use, as I needed something to help me keep structured information about my trips.
However, as I was getting ready to push this to production I realised it would be a good idea to go public and publish the source code.
There are, of course, some things to be done before this would be of any real use to anyone but me and in the process some breaking changes may occur.
