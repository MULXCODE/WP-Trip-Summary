<h2 id="dg-about">About</h2>
<h3 id="dg-project-purpose">Purpose of This Project</h3>
<p>I initially started this project for my own personal use, as something to help me keep some structured information about my trips.<br />
Along the way, though, I thought there might be a chance of it being of use to some other people as well; so I decided to open-source it under an unrestrictive license.<br />
By and large, this plug-in manages the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>a technical summary - details such as: total distance, total climb, surface/terrain type etc.;</li>
<li>the GPX track for the trip, displayed on a map with no additional ceremony besides two marker that pinpoint the start (green marker) and the end (red marker).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dg-trip-types">Supported Trip Types</h3>
<p>The technical summary supports data management for the following trip types:</p>
<ul>
<li>bike trips;</li>
<li>trekking/hiking trips;</li>
<li>train rides.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you can only document this sort of trips.</p>
<h3 id="dg-main-plugin-components">Main Plug-in Components</h3>
<p>Depending on the various functions performed by various plug-in components, we can define three major ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Viewer Component: the box displayed just below the post; this box displayed the kind of information I just mentioned above (<a href="#viewer-component">More details here</a>);</li>
<li>The Editor Component: it is attached to the main post editing form and allows adding/modifying/deleting of trip related data (<a href="#editor-component">More details here</a>);</li>
<li>The Configuration Component: handles plug-in option management, but also the look-up data management (various lists of values from which one can be selected when filling various selector fields in the trip data editor)(<a href="#configuration-component">More details here</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="viewer-component">The Viewer Component</h1>
<p>The viewer component is comprised of three distinct areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>the top teaser;</li>
<li>the bottom teaser;</li>
<li>the technical box itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Top Teaser</h2>
<p>This is a small box (yellowish, by default) displayed above the post content, but below the post title.<br />
Its purpose is to guide the readers to the technical box.<br />
The idea is to let everyone know that there such thing as a technical box and, if that's the only thing they're searching for, quickly take them there.</p>
<p><a href="#help-root">Back to the Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2>The Bottom Teaser</h2>
<p>Yet another small box (also yellowish, by default), but displayed below the post content.<br />
It is not always displayed, but only when the system detects that the user might have skipped the content (i.e. scrolled too fast), in which case the reader is encouraged to jump back to the beginning of the post to read the post.</p>
<p><a href="#help-root">Back to the Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2>The Technical Box</h2>
<p>This is the area where, each on a distinct tab, the following sections are displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li>the map that displays the route;</li>
<li>technical stuff (total distance, total climb etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each tab is only displayed when the corresponding information has been provided by the post author.<br />
If there is not any kind of information for any of these tabs, then the entire component is hidden, including the teasers.</p>
<p><a href="#help-root">Back to the Table of Contents</a></p>
<h1 id="editor-component">The Editor Component</h1>
<p>The editing component allows editing the trip's technical summary, as well as uploading the GPX track.<br />
Thus, it to is organized in two tabs, one for each category of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>the technical summary details editing form;</li>
<li>the GPX track upload &amp; preview area.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Technical Summary Details Editing Form</h2>
<p>The corresponding tab is simply named &quot;Info&quot;.<br />
If no information has been filled in, the form only displays three buttons, one for each supported trip type:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Biking&quot; - configures the form with the fields required to input bike trip related details;</li>
<li>&quot;Hiking&quot; - configures the form with the fields required to input hiking trip related details;</li>
<li>&quot;Train ride&quot; - configures the form with the fields required to input train ride related details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also note that, regardless of the form, if any of the fields that require an existing lookup data set to select from does not have any such value defined, then a link will be displayed pointing towards the management page for that set.</p>
<p>Besides the form, on the bottom side of the screen two additional control buttons will be shown, right after a trip type has been selected:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Save&quot; - used to save the changes;</li>
<li>&quot;Clear&quot; - used to when the entire trip information set needs to be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#help-root">Back to the Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2>The GPX Track Upload &amp; Preview Area</h2>
<p>The corresponding tab is simply named &quot;Map&quot;.<br />
If no track has been uploaded yet, then this screen only displays a button that allows browsing for a GPX track file on the local computer.</p>
<p>Once the track has been uploaded, the map will be centered and the zoom level adjusted to the maximum value for which the entire track is displayed. GPX files that contain disconnected multiple segments are also supported.</p>
<p>Besides the form, on the bottom side of the screen two additional control buttons will be shown, right after a trip type has been selected:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Save&quot; - used to save the changes;</li>
<li>&quot;Clear&quot; - used to when the entire track needs to be removed.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#help-root">Back to the Table of Contents</a></p>
<h1 id="configuration-management">Configuration &amp; Management</h1>
<ul>
<li><a href="#configure-general-options">General Options</a></li>
<li><a href="#configure-lookup-data">Lookup Data Management</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration elements can be seen as forming two discrete sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>general options - measurement units, enabling or disabling various interface elements etc.;</li>
<li>lookup data management - these are data sets of predefined options from which some fields are filled in, such as the Difficulty Level.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="configure-general-options">General Options</h2>
<p>There is a dedicated page where these options may be modified to best suit your needs. One can get there by accessing Trip Summary -&gt; Settings in the main menu.</p>
<p>Once there, the following settings are made available.</p>
<h4>The Measurement Unit System</h4>
<p>The plug-in supports the metric system (m/km) as well as the imperial system (mile/inch).<br />
It is worth mentioning that the plug-in does not perform any conversion and it assumes that any value provided is already expressed in the chosen measurement unit. Also, when the measurement units are changed, the values are not automatically converted.</p>
<h4>Whether to Display the Teasers or Not</h4>
<p>Once the field is unchecked and the changes are saved, the teasers will no longer be displayed (nor the top teaser, nor the bottom teaser).</p>
<h4>The Top Teaser Text</h4>
<p>The text shown in the top teaser (above the post content, but right below the title).</p>
<h4>The Bottom Teaser Text</h4>
<p>The text shown in the bottom teaser (right below the technical summary box).</p>
<h4>Map Tile URL Template</h4>
<p>The discussion here is a bit longer.</p>
<p>First of all, one has to keep in mind that the map is not displayed as only one physical image, but using multiple images. These images - called tiles - when put together in a specific order, form the image of the map itself.</p>
<p>Also, there are multiple set of tiles, one for each zoom level and, within each set, each tile is located using two coordinates - let us name them x &amp; y - sort of like squares on a chess board.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to access &amp; load a tile from whatever server provides them, we need to request it using the following pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>z - the zoom level;</li>
<li>x - horizontal position;</li>
<li>y - vertical position.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one more problem, though: in order to load that many images in a reasonable time, they are replicated between multiple machines/servers and the tile requests are split between them. That's not mandatory, but often used.<br />
These servers are also numbered - for instance: 1, 2, 3, 4 etc.</p>
<p>This, then, might add another variable when requesting tiles and also when supplying the URL template that will be used to display the map wherever this plug-in requires it.<br />
Add this to the set of coordinates described above and we have this list of supported URL template variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>{s} - to specify where the tile server number should be added (eg. {s}.tile.osm.org would translate to 1.tile.osm.org, 2.tile.osm.org etc.);</li>
<li>{z} - to specify where the zoom level needs to be inserted;</li>
<li>{x} - to specify where the tile x coordinate needs to be inserted;</li>
<li>{y} - to specify where the tile y coordinate needs to be inserted.</li>
</ul>
<p>These variables can occur anywhere in the string and one must consult the map tile provider to find out the supported URL template.</p>
<h4>Map Tile Layer Attribution URL</h4>
<p>Depending on where you chose to display the map from, the attribution may or may not be mandatory. It is, at a minimum, a nice thing to have, so I encourage you to do it.<br />
The attribution is placed in the lower right corner of the map area and this field allows you to add a URL to the provider's page.</p>
<h4>Map Tile Layer Attribution Text</h4>
<p>Depending on where you chose to display the map from, the attribution may or may not be mandatory. It is, at a minimum, a nice thing to have, so I encourage you to do it.<br />
The attribution is placed in the lower right corner of the map area and this field allows you to add a text that describes the provider (a copyright notice of sorts).</p>
<h4>Enable Map Full-screen Mode?</h4>
<p>Once the field is unchecked and the changes are saved, the full-screen button will not be displayed in the Viewer Component anymore.<br />
By default, this field is checked, so the button is displayed.</p>
<h4>Show Magnifying Glass?</h4>
<p>Once the field is unchecked and the changes are saved, the magnifying glass switch button will no longer be displayed.<br />
By default, this field is checked, so the button is displayed.</p>
<h4>Show Map Scale?</h4>
<p>Once the field is unchecked and the changes are saved, the map scale will no longer be displayed in the lower left corner of the map area.<br />
By default, this field is checked, so the map scale is displayed.</p>
<h4>Allow Track Download?</h4>
<p>Once the field is unchecked and the changes are saved, the GPX track download button will no longer be displayed.<br />
By default, this field is checked, so the button is displayed.</p>
<p><a href="#help-root">Back to the Table of Contents</a></p>
<h2 id="configure-lookup-data">Lookup Data Management</h2>
<p>Lookup data represents a couple of sets of predefined options out of which some fields are filled in. Some fields only required one value, some multiple.<br />
The plug-in supports per-language values for each option in a data set.<br />
Also, one can define said values for any WordPress-supported language.<br />
Then, there is the possibility of selecting a default value: this is the value displayed when, for any given option, no explicit value is found in the context of the current language.</p>
